## ☸️ Introduction to Kubernetes


**K8s** is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes is designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps developers and operators run applications reliably in production environments by managing containers across a cluster of machines.

Key capabilities of Kubernetes include:
- Automatic deployment and rollback of applications  
- Horizontal scaling based on demand  
- Self healing (restarting failed containers)  
- Service discovery and load balancing  
- Configuration and secret management  

By abstracting the underlying infrastructure, Kubernetes allows applications to run consistently across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments, making it a core technology in modern cloud-native systems.
